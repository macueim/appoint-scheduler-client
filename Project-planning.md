I'm building a small business appointment scheduler for local entrepreneurs like barbers, stylists, consultants, or tutors. This is only the frontend portion using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS. Please help me plan this application with the following:

1. Key features needed for a minimum viable product (MVP)
2. User stories for both business owners and clients
3. A simple data model for storing:
   - Business information
   - Service offerings
   - Appointments
   - Clients
4. Basic workflow for how the application should function
5. Technical considerations for a frontend using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS

Don't create the code inside jupyter notebook. Show the code, one page at a time.
My technical knowledge is beginner-intermediate level with some understanding of HTML and basic database concepts.

Certainly! Following best practices for frontend development, here's a well-structured project folder setup for your **Small Business Appointment Scheduler** using **HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine JS**:

```
appoint-scheduler-client/
│── public/                     # Static assets
│   ├── images/                 # Logo, icons, and other images
│   ├── fonts/                  # Custom fonts, if any
│   ├── favicon.ico             # Favicon for the application
│── src/                        # Main source directory
│   ├── components/             # Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, etc.)

```

### **Explanation of Key Directories:**
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and favicon files.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI elements for modular design.
- **`src/pages/`**: Houses individual pages like `home.html`, `dashboard.html`, etc.
- **`src/styles/`**: Holds Tailwind CSS configurations and custom styles.
- **`src/scripts/`**: Manages Alpine.js functionality and other interactivity scripts.
- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files for Tailwind CSS.
- **`dist/`**: Acts as the build folder, storing optimized and compiled assets.

This structure promotes **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**, ensuring a smooth development workflow.
