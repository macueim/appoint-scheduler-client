I'm building a small business appointment scheduler for local entrepreneurs like barbers, stylists, consultants, or tutors. This is only the frontend portion using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS. Please help me plan this application with the following:

1. Key features needed for a minimum viable product (MVP)
2. User stories for both business owners and clients
3. A simple data model for storing:
   - Business information
   - Service offerings
   - Appointments
   - Clients
4. Basic workflow for how the application should function
5. Technical considerations for a frontend using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS

Don't create the code inside jupyter notebook. Show the code, one page at a time.
My technical knowledge is beginner-intermediate level with some understanding of HTML and basic database concepts.

Certainly! Following best practices for frontend development, here's a well-structured project folder setup for your **Small Business Appointment Scheduler** using **HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine JS**:

```

### **Explanation of Key Directories:**
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and favicon files.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI elements for modular design.
- **`src/pages/`**: Houses individual pages like `home.html`, `dashboard.html`, etc.
- **`src/styles/`**: Holds Tailwind CSS configurations and custom styles.
- **`src/scripts/`**: Manages Alpine.js functionality and other interactivity scripts.
- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files for Tailwind CSS.
- **`dist/`**: Acts as the build folder, storing optimized and compiled assets.

This structure promotes **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

======================================

4) 4. Service Setup Page (service-setup.html)

Context:

I want to develop a service page that shows all available services by categories. allows manager to perform CRUD operation on them.

Businesses can manage their services and availability through this section, performing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, including:
•	Adding, editing, or removing services visible to the public.
•	Managing appointments and client interactions.

Display Business ID, Name, Description, and Joined date.
in addition, allowing business to create a new service based on their specifications.

Use html5 for structure, tailwindCSS for styling, and alpine js for interactivity.

the data source for service categories is the following URL:https://appointment-scheduler-backend-smss.onrender.com/service-categories

and the response is coming back in json format as the following:

"

    {
        "id": 1,

### About us page: about-us.html
Following best practices, build a professional “About Us” page for a small business appointment application that is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The application is designed for local entrepreneurs, including barbers, stylists, consultants, and tutors. This project will focus exclusively on the frontend development using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS.
In “About Us” page highlight the main goal the application such as the following:
•	Provide a seamless experience for business owners to post their services and availability.
•	Allow service seekers to view, book, and pay for appointments in advance, including discounted offers.
This “About Us” page will use header and footer of the index.html file/page.


### Signup and login pages:
## Authentication & Security Recommendations
Here are professional recommendations for implementing secure authentication and role-based access control in your AppointScheduler application:
### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication:
    - Implement short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes)
    - Use refresh tokens for obtaining new access tokens
    - Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks

2. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    - Offer SMS or authenticator app options for 2FA
    - Make it optional but encouraged for all users
    - Require MFA for sensitive operations (payment, profile changes)

3. **Password Security**:
    - Enforce strong passwords (as implemented in the signup form)
    - Store passwords with bcrypt or Argon2 hashing (never plain text)
    - Implement account lockout after failed attempts (e.g., 5 attempts, then 15-minute lockout)

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
I recommend implementing the following roles:
1. **Client/Customer Role**:
    - Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments
    - View service providers and their availability
    - View and edit personal profile
    - View past appointment history

2. **Service Provider Role**:
    - Manage service offerings (add, edit, delete services)
    - Set availability schedule
    - Accept or reject appointment requests
    - View client information for confirmed appointments

3. **Admin Role**:
    - Manage all users (providers and clients)
    - View system-wide analytics
    - Configure global application settings
    - Handle dispute resolution

4. **Guest Role** (unauthenticated):
    - Browse service providers
    - View service descriptions
    - Create an account

### 3. Security Best Practices
1. **HTTPS Everywhere**:
    - Secure all communications with TLS/SSL
    - Implement HSTS headers

2. **API Security**:
    - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
    - Input validation on both client and server side
    - Implement proper CORS configuration

3. **Session Management**:
    - Implement session expiration
    - Allow users to view and terminate active sessions
    - Auto logout after period of inactivity

4. **Secure Account Recovery**:
    - Implement a secure password reset flow
    - Use time-limited, single-use tokens for password reset
    - Notify users of password changes via email

5. **Data Protection**:
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
    - Implement proper database access controls
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing

### 4. Frontend Security Enhancements
1. **Implement CSP** (Content Security Policy) to prevent XSS attacks
2. **Set secure and SameSite cookies** for better protection against CSRF attacks
3. **Add invisible honeypot fields** in forms to catch automated bots

### 5. Compliance Considerations
Depending on your target market and the type of data collected:
1. **GDPR Compliance** for European users:
    - Clear consent mechanisms
    - Data export and deletion capabilities
    - Privacy policy and cookie notices

2. **HIPAA Compliance** (if handling health-related appointments):
    - Additional security measures for PHI
    - Audit logs for all data access
    - Business associate agreements

### Implementation Approach
For a professional implementation, I recommend:
1. **Backend Authentication Service**:
    - Use a trusted authentication library/framework (like Passport.js for Node.js)
    - Create dedicated auth endpoints for login, signup, password reset, etc.

2. **Frontend Authentication Flow**:
    - Implement login persistence with refresh tokens
    - Add route guards based on user roles
    - Handle token expiration gracefully

3. **API Authorization**:
    - Implement middleware to check user roles before allowing access to endpoints
    - Maintain a permissions matrix mapping roles to specific operations

These authentication pages and recommendations provide a solid foundation for secure user management in your AppointScheduler application.
